# Melbourne Housing Market:house_with_garden:
Jupyter Notebook contains Melbourne Housing Market analysis with Random Forest and Linear Regression. The dataset used was based on [Tony Pino's Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market) (which I attached on this repo).

## Requirements
- `Google Colab`
- `Anaconda`
- `Python`

## Disclaimer
- This notebook was made by _me_, _Ega Pamungkas_, _Reza Setiabudi_, and _Clemens Jericho_ due to our Machine Learning Final Project. 
- Some code inspired from sources which scattered on the internet, so you might see a little bit similarity. 
- And some of the comments were added in Indonesian to help our lecturer understand about the process we did.

## Notes
You can see our explanation regarding this repo through video on this [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EgTInuNQfw&feature=youtu.be) which is spoken in Indonesian.
